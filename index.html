			    SandDance is a browser based information
			    visualization system prototype created at Microsoft
			    SandDance lets you see
			    both the individual records, and their overall
			    structure. SandDance focusses on natural user
			    interaction techniques. Touch interaction is a first
			    class citizen, allowing the entire experience to be
			    easily operated through a touch screen. The system
			    also understand speech commands for searching,
			    selecting, focusing and filtering the data. A kinect
			    system can be used to sense gestures for moving
			    between views of the data. Collaboration is
			    supported by allowing multiple sets of people to
			    interact with the same dataset. Selections and
			    filters in one system are automatically replicated
			    to other systems viewing the data.

                                        As more applications move from the desktop to touch
                                        devices like tablets, designers must wrestle with the
                                        costs of porting a design with as little revision of the
                                        UI as possible from one device to the other, or of
                                        optimizing the interaction per device. We consider the
                                        tradeoffs between two versions of a UI for working with
                                        data on a touch tablet. One interface is based on using
                                        the conventional desktop metaphor (WIMP) with a control
                                        panel, push buttons, and checkboxes where the mouse click
                                        is effectively replaced by a finger tap. The other
                                        interface (which we call FLUID) eliminates the control
                                        panel and focuses touch actions on the data visualization
                                        itself. We describe our design process and evaluation of
                                        each interface. We discuss the significantly better task
                                        performance and preference for the FLUID interface, in
                                        particular how touch design may challenge certain
                                        assumptions about the performance benefits of WIMP
                                        interfaces that do not hold on touch devices, such as the
                                        superiority of gestural vs. control panel based
                                        interaction.
