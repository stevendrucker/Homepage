        "Executive Summary (when available)": "\"Still and dynamic image juxtaposition has recently become more prevalent; however, conventional image editing tools for combining such images are oftentimes time-consuming and complicated, while providing limited refinement operations. The invention is a set of temporal mapping functions that map input spatiotemporal segments from an input video to output segments, where the functions can respectively play, loop, or mirror an input segment or map the input segment as a still image.  Selections of spatial regions, start times, and end times within the input video define input spatiotemporal segments, and at least one of the input spatiotemporal segments can be spatially or temporally refined.  Claims are directed to setting subsets of a spatiotemporal volume of pixels in the input video as input segments, mapping input segments to output segments based on predefined temporal mapping functions, and compositing the output segments to create a cliplet.\"",

        "Executive Summary (when available)": "\"Conventionally, browsers arrange and display content in a fixed spatial scale based on display settings such as resolution and size thus limiting ability to show greater amount of information to be provided to the user. The invention defines tags with view-level display properties for published content in which the tags dictate display based upon a particular location or plane of view (view-level) for published content.  For example, a first view-level of a web site can have content with a first tag defining view-level display properties whereas a second view level of the web site can be rendered differently based on a second tag defining view-level properties.  The view-level display property can be a visibility attribute, a priority definition, a resolution definition, a scale/size factor, a pre-defined viewing experience etc... Claims are directed towards a system for rendering a portion of published content within a browsing session using tags.\"",

Hence, while rarely used for such, biometrics can be better employed for identification and/or convenience rather than strong authentication.  The invention is an architecture that can identify a user of a device based upon obtaining a biometric, then configuring that device with settings associated with the user.  For example, based upon a grip configuration, hand geometry, or fingerprint, obtained as the user picks up a television remote, the invention can identify the user and apply associated settings (e.g., preferred volume, favorite channel lists, etc.) to the device or peripherals.  In addition to data sets, the settings can also relate to physical configurations such as size, shape, texture, tension, firmness, etc.  The claims are direct to a system and method that\"",

This invention learns face recognition from a set of training images by finding the best image characteristics that characterize a given face and retaining these as a multidimensional array?a tensor.  The system iteratively forms a set of optimal tensor projections that characterize a face, such that the face is recognizable across changes yet distinguishable from different faces.  The tensor projections are obtained orthogonally to each other.  Mutual orthogonality is the most novel element and allows the system to better generalize the face across diverse changes.

The invention is a method of allowing multiple modes of input into the shared display using a set of modules that accept and display data from a variety of sources so that a greater percentage of the audience of the shared display are enabled to participate.  I/O modules are able to understand data from a single mode of communication and to be able to generate messages as output accordingly.  Translation modules take discrete message units and convert them into commands or requests that can be processed by the logic module.  Logic modules include any application that is running on the shared display.  Layout modules lay out the information output by the logic module.  Display modules take layout data and convert the information to a form that can be readily displayed on the displ\"",

The invention is an improved method for browsing objects in which the user starts with one or a few objects, and related clusters are displayed on the screen which share metadata with the initial objects along several different axes.   For example, a media variations browser shows a single movie in the center of the screen while 4 clusters of movies are shown in the periphery which share a common actor or a common director with the central movie. A user can then select any item in a peripheral cluster and bring that to be the focus for new clusters of movies.  This method of browsing can be generalized to almost any space whose objects have been richly annotated with metadata.\"",

A VWE can be provided that integrates multimedia and doesn't require large amounts of static environment by attributing affected regions to each of the objects representing artifacts, rooms, portals or avatars such when an avatar manipulates its surroundings, the only updates that need be made are those in the same affected region.  In this way, a local region of objects is updated only for those clients affected by the change in the VWE.  Useful for rich VWE experience without the corresponding processor and bandwidth limitations.  Claims are drawn to a gaming or chat room type environment.\"",

The graphical data compression algorithm makes use of the principle that corners normal information can be inferred from the geometry and connectivity of a mesh of triangles.  Vertex rotation continuity data is used to encode the continuity around vertices between the faces of adjacent triangles.\"",
